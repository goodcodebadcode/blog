[{"content":"I learnt my trade as a software developer in the early 2000’s with Visual Basic 6.0 and Windows 98, although I spent a large part of my time in the early days writing code in the first versions of Delphi - with that excellent programming language named after French physicist, Blaise Pascal.\nToday, I consider myself an experienced software engineer and architect with a focus on Software Architecture, DevOps Technical Practices and Principles, Containers and Distributed Systems.\nOn the opposite side of that coin is a deep interest in the human side of software development. I find that whilst computers are fascinating machines, they are mostly a reflection of the people using them. I firmly believe that to be a true well-rounded engineer, focusing on code is not enough; you have to study the people behind the software, too.\nWhy write a blog? As a profession, writing software is relatively young, not only that, a large majority of the industry is still getting to grips with the necessary tools and techniques to build great software. This has become even more relevant as people learn to code at an earlier age, as a hobby or for a change in career.\nSo, whilst technologies come and go, the foundational patterns and technical practices are always present. This blog mostly gives me a place to put down my own thoughts on a topic and provides me with a way to keep track of software engineering practices over time.\nGood Code vs Bad Code This is an image from the Robert C. Martin book Clean Code and is used to illustrate a common problem experienced by teams and companies alike.\nClean Code is not only considered one of the greatest programming books of all-time, it is also one of my personal favorites. I think every practicing software developer should at least own a copy, or at least through open minded discussion, understand what lies within its pages.\nHow can I get in touch? I believe that blogs can be a two-way discussion, so I welcome emails and comments – as long as they\u0026rsquo;re on topic and polite.\n david@goodcodebadcode.com @goodcodebadcode GitHub for related code samples  ","permalink":"https://goodcodebadcode.dev/about/","summary":"about","title":"About"},{"content":"","permalink":"https://goodcodebadcode.dev/archives/","summary":"","title":"Archive"},{"content":"","permalink":"https://goodcodebadcode.dev/search/","summary":"","title":"Search"}]
