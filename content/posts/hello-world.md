Well, it's up. After messing around with Hugo and Netlify environment variables for an hour, my blog is up.

## Why write a blog?

As a profession, writing software is relatively young, not only that, a large majority of the industry is still getting to grips with the necessary tools and techniques to build great software. This has become even more relevant as people learn to code at an earlier age, as a hobby or for a change in career.

So, whilst technologies come and go, the foundational patterns and technical practices are always present.

On the opposite side of that coin is a deep interest in the human side of software development. I find that whilst computers are fascinating machines, they are mostly a reflection of the people using them. I firmly believe that to be a true well-rounded engineer, focusing on code is not enough; you have to study the people behind the software, too.

## What type of posts?

I will publish articles that cover a broad range of topics around software development, agile, and data science. I will also share articles from other authors who share my philosophy on topics such as agile and have an appreciation for the importance of technical skill in making that style work effectively.

## On the shoulders of giants

Whilst I don't come up with these original ideas, I do a pretty good job of recognising and packaging the ideas of others into something that is hopefully easy to understand.

Thanks for reading.
