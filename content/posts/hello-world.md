Well, it's up. After messing around with Hugo and Netlify environment variables 
for an hour, my blog is up.

## Why write a blog?

As a profession, writing software is relatively young, not only that, a large 
majority of the industry is still getting to grips with the necessary tools and 
techniques to build great software. This has become even more relevant as people 
learn to code at an earlier age, as a hobby or for a change in career.

So, whilst technologies come and go, the foundational patterns and technical 
practices are always present. 

On the opposite side of that coin is a deep interest in the human side of 
software development. I find that whilst computers are fascinating machines, 
they are mostly a reflection of the people using them. I firmly believe that to 
be a true well-rounded engineer, focusing on code is not enough; you have to 
study the people behind the software, too.

## What type of posts?

I will publish articles that cover a broad range of topics around software 
development, agile, and data science.  I will also share articles from other 
authors who share my philosophy on topics such as agile and have an appreciation 
for the importance of technical skill in making that style work effectively.

## Who is this blog for?

As a technical architect, my main focus has been to understand how to design, 
build and deploy software systems, to maximise the value development teams can 
deliver. 

In doing this I've looked to understand the patterns of good software architecture, 
and also the processes that support good software design. I've become a big fan 
of lean and agile methodologies and the resulting focus on evolutionary software 
architecture. 

## Standing on the shoulders of giants

Whilst I don't come up with these original ideas, I do a pretty good job of 
recognising and  packaging the ideas of others into something that is hopefully 
easy to understand.
