In a profession as vast and varied as software engineering, constant learning and reading is essential for building foundational knowledge.

## Software Craft(wo)manship

As developers, we rarely have the time to perfect a single piece of code. The idea of perfect code is a fantasy, and everything we write has flaws. Yet, we should always endeavour to produce the best possible code given our constraints. These constrains come in the form of deadlines, business demands, and personal fatigue. So, whilst different business conditions may set the boundaries on what is “possible”, a developer always has some control over the quality of his or her work.

The bottom line is that code that “works” is not always “done”. If our primary focus is to produce a product that solves a business problem, then does it really matter how the problem is solved? Yes. Clients, users, companies, and other developers all benefit in the long term. Code that is messy, rushed, or just “good enough” is code with an eye on short-term returns. This is literally the definition of technical debt, a metaphor, originally attributed to Ward Cunningham.

Martin summarises this as: High-quality input (thoughtful, maintainable, flexible code), results in high-quality output (long-term business payoffs).

## What is Clean Code?

Everyone has his or her own list of what makes for clean code, and each language has its own implementation — indeed, Martin’s book begins with a collection of definitions given by various software luminaries. Here is my list:

**Clean Code vs Quick Code**

**Managing Complexity**

**Technical Debt**

**In Conclusion**
