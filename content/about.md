I learnt my trade as a software developer in the early 2000’s with Visual Basic 
6.0 and Windows 98, although I spent a large part of my time in the early days 
writing code in the first versions of Delphi - with that excellent 
[programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)) 
named after French physicist, [Blaise Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal). 

Today, I consider myself an experienced software engineer and architect with a 
focus on Software Architecture, DevOps Technical Practices and Principles, 
Containers and Distributed Systems. 

On the opposite side of that coin is a deep interest in the human side of 
software development. I find that whilst computers are fascinating machines, 
they are mostly a reflection of the people using them. I firmly believe that to 
be a true well-rounded engineer, focusing on code is not enough; you have to 
study the people behind the software, too.

## Why write a blog?

As a profession, writing software is relatively young, not only that, a large 
majority of the industry is still getting to grips with the necessary tools and 
techniques to build great software. This has become even more relevant as people 
learn to code at an earlier age, as a hobby or for a change in career.

So, whilst technologies come and go, the foundational patterns and technical 
practices are always present. This blog mostly gives me a place to put down 
my own thoughts on a topic and provides me with a way to keep track of software 
engineering practices over time.

## Good Code vs Bad Code

This is an image from the [Robert C. Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin) 
book [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) 
and is used to illustrate a common problem experienced by teams and companies 
alike.

Clean Code is not only considered one of the greatest programming books of 
all-time, it is also one of my personal favorites. I think every practicing 
software developer should at least own a copy, or at least through open minded
discussion, understand what lies within its pages.

## How can I get in touch?

I believe that blogs can be a two-way discussion, so I welcome emails and 
comments – as long as they're on topic and polite.
