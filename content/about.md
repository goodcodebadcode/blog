This blog is a repository of knowledge gained, lessons learned and experiences from the front line of software development over the last fifteen years.

Written by Alan, technical architect and principal software engineer.

I learnt my trade as a software developer in the mid 2000’s with Classic ASP, although I spent a large part of my time in the early days writing code in Visual Basic.

As a technical architect, my main focus has been to understand how to design, build and deploy software systems, to maximise the value development teams can deliver.

In doing this I've looked to understand the patterns of good software architecture, and also the processes that support good software design. I've become a big fan of lean and agile methodologies and the resulting focus on evolutionary software architecture.

## Good Code vs Bad Code

This is an image from the [Robert C. Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin) book [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) and is used to illustrate a common problem experienced by teams and companies alike.

Clean Code is not only considered one of the greatest programming books of all-time, it is also one of my personal favourites. I think every practicing software developer should at least own a copy, or at least through open minded discussion, understand what lies within its pages.

## How can I get in touch?

I believe that blogs can be a two-way discussion, so I welcome emails and comments – as long as they're on topic and polite.
