This blog is a repository of knowledge gained, lessons learned and experiences 
from the front line of software development over the last fifteen years.

Written by David, technical architect and principal software engineer.

I learnt my trade as a software developer in the mid 2000’s with Classic ASP, although I spent a large part of my time in the early days writing code in Visual Basic.

## Good Code vs Bad Code

This is an image from the [Robert C. Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin) 
book [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) 
and is used to illustrate a common problem experienced by teams and companies 
alike.

Clean Code is not only considered one of the greatest programming books of 
all-time, it is also one of my personal favourites. I think every practicing 
software developer should at least own a copy, or at least through open minded
discussion, understand what lies within its pages.

## How can I get in touch?

I believe that blogs can be a two-way discussion, so I welcome emails and 
comments – as long as they're on topic and polite.
